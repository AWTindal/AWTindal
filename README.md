I'm a newly IT & Cyber Security Professional that has found an enormous amount of passion for everything cyber! I pivoted my education from Biology to IT a year ago and have been through bootcamps and online certificates to further my education and understanding of the field. I hope that my curiosity and passion for the field can be shown through my projects, as I attempt to strengthen my knowledge and skills.


## Objective


My journey in IT has led me to develop a deep passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst. I also plan to veer into Cloud Security in the future as I continue to bolster my skills through projects and certifications with Microsoft Azure.
